# turbine_status_prediction
This repository contains a Streamlit-based dashboard for predicting the operational status (Active or Inactive) of wind turbines and calculating their power generation in kilowatts based on various input parameters. The model leverages machine learning for prediction and includes a simulation of turbine status over time.
